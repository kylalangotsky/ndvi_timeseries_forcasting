# NDVI Timeseries Forecasting

Forecasting NDVI values using ConvLSTM.

### Methodology

Forecasting a timeseries of NDVI values using previous NDVI, precipitation, and temperature as predictors. Using ConvLSTM to extract both the temporal and spatial patterns of the data.

Steps:
1. Download all input data.
2. Resample each dataset to desired temporal & spatial resolutions.
    - Currently: 8 day & 9x9km
4. Combine datasets based on coordinates & time (using "nearest" method).
5. Normalize datasets.
6. Create & compile model.
7. Run model for train & validation sets.
8. Repeat steps 6 & 7 with different architectures and hyperparameters to fine-tune the model (based on validation score, trendline analysis, and examination of spatial accuracy).
9. Run predictions for test set.


### Current results

Timeseries & spatial elements picked up quite well. ConvLSTM results are slightly blurred, which is a well known effect of the algorithm. Need to test a rolling prediction for a longer timeseries as well as predicting different times of year.
